Use of Distributed computing to run a potentially parallel task with the help of several heterogenous computational resources.
Here we simulated a computation of counting the number of digits between a range [a,b).

- All the code is pretty much self-understandable and commented wherever necessary :)



Sample input/output:
-------------

[The output hugely varies on the input and the number of clients. So, we fix the input range from 1 to 100 and the client connections to 5]

./Server
[Once enough clients have joined to start the computation, input a start and an end range.]
1 100
[Observe the output on each client's end]

=> Output on server:

Locked execution
CONST = 10, i = 0
Sending data 1 11 from 1 to 11 to client 1
CONST = 10, i = 0
Sending data 11 21 from 11 to 21 to client 2
CONST = 10, i = 0
Sending data 21 31 from 21 to 31 to client 3
CONST = 10, i = 0
Sending data 31 41 from 31 to 41 to client 4
CONST = 10, i = 0
Sending data 41 51 from 41 to 51 to client 5
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
Locked execution
CONST = 10, i = 1
Sending data 51 61 from 51 to 61 to client 1
CONST = 10, i = 1
Sending data 61 71 from 61 to 71 to client 2
CONST = 10, i = 1
Sending data 71 81 from 71 to 81 to client 3
CONST = 10, i = 1
Sending data 81 91 from 81 to 91 to client 4
CONST = 10, i = 1
Sending data 91 101 from 91 to 101 to client 5
Enter the start and end range: 
  RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 
RECIEVED DATA = 10 



=> Output on client_1:
Computed range: 1 11
SENT data: 10
Computed range: 51 61
SENT data: 10

=> Output on client_2:
Computed range: 11 21
SENT data: 10
Computed range: 61 71
SENT data: 10

=> Output on client_3:
Computed range: 21 31
SENT data: 10
Computed range: 71 81
SENT data: 10

=> Output on client_4:
Computed range: 31 41
SENT data: 10
Computed range: 81 91
SENT data: 10

=> Output on client_5:
Computed range: 41 51
SENT data: 10
Computed range: 91 101
SENT data: 10


Conclusion:
------------

Our aim is to show the potential of distributed computing in tasks that can be divided easily into independent sub-tasks.
